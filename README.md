# Discord-Bot
<p>A house for code for my passion project, my Discord Bot.</p>
<p>I've worked on this project for all of highschoolâ€”I just wanted a bot that could mute everyone in a voice call for a round of Among Us, and then it turned into... a lot more than that. It queried textbook pdfs on demand for AP World and AP US, provided math support, spanish conjugations, vaccine distribution data, and so much more. I've loved the time spent working on this and it really is almost a child to me.</p>
